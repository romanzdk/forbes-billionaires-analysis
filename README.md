# Forbes Billionaires analysis

In this analysis I took a look at the Forbes Billionaires over the past 10 years.

Most of the Billionaires are Men from USA, aged 50-80 from Finance sector.

During the past 10 years only Warren Buffett and Bill Gates were able to remain in the top 5.

From the technical perspective I had to scrape/download data from the Forbes website, merge all the years together (done using Python) and then visualize with Tableau.
